# This same watcher script runs concurrently in many addon repos. We must NOT
# bail just because *a* wow-version-replication.ps1 is running somewhere else
# (that's a different addon). The guard is keyed on THIS repo's own source path,
# so:
#   * a second launch on the SAME repo (e.g. a VS Code window reload firing the
#     folderOpen task again) finds the mutex held and exits cleanly -- no racing
#     watchers mangling the same files;
#   * a watcher for a DIFFERENT addon has a different source path -> different
#     mutex name -> both run happily side by side.
#
# A named Mutex (kernel object) is used rather than scanning process command
# lines, because command-line matching is fragile: relative vs absolute launch
# paths, quoting, and "which addon is this" are all unreliable to parse. The
# mutex is released automatically when this process exits (crash, Ctrl+C, or
# normal stop), so a dead watcher never blocks a fresh one.

# even while a real watcher holds the mutex.
